Problem Solving with C++ teaches programming techniques and the C++ language, while the Visual C++ 6.0 Companion discusses Visual C++ C++ language enhanced by Microsoft with an editor, a compiler, and a debugger which is designed to accommodate and take full advantage of the Windows operating system. A CD-ROM featuring the Visual C++ language is also included. This book brings the best-selling text book for introducing C++ to fully embrace the most up-to-date C++ standards. Suitable for beginning students, the text covers C++ and basic programming techniques. Students will elarn how to define their own classes whilel gaining a solid understanding of basic tools such as simple control structures and function definitions. By defining their own classes early, students are getting a hands-on experience unrivaled by any other text on the market. Flexible by design, the order in which chapters and sections are covered can easily be changed without any loss on continuity in reading. Instructors can therefore mold this text around the way they want to teach rather than have the text dictate their course's organization.",

Understanding computer science is becoming a necessity in the modern age. As our world shifts towards becoming increasingly more technical and automated, the ability to code and understand computers has become one of the most valuable skills any child can have on the road to a successful life. More and more schools are recognizing this importance and have started to implement computer science and coding as core elements in their curriculums, right alongside math and history. The Everything Kids’ Scratch Coding Book helps children get a head start on this new essential skill, with Scratch coding—a language designed by MIT specifically to help a younger audience learn to code. In no time, children will learn basic coding concepts, build fun games, and get a competitive edge on their classmates. This book encourages children to think analytically and problem-solve, while helping them develop an essential skill that will last them a lifetime.",

Calling all coders, this is a straightforward, visual guide to helping kids understand the basics of computer coding using Scratch and Python coding languages. Essential coding concepts like scripts, variables, and strings are explained using build-along projects and games. Kids can create online games to play like Monkey Mayhem and Bubble Blaster, draw mazes and shapes, build animations, and more using the step-by-step examples to follow and customize. Seven projects let kids (and their parents) practice the skills as they are learning in each section of the book. Kids get instant results, even when completely new to coding. Packed with visual examples, expert tips, a glossary of key terms, and extras such as profiles of famous coders, Help Your Kids with Computer Coding lays a hands-on foundation for computer programming, so adults and kids can learn together. Supporting STEM education initiatives, computer coding teaches kids how to think creatively, work collaboratively, and reason systematically, and is quickly becoming a necessary and sought-after skill.

          "description": "Coding for Beginners in easy steps has an easy-to-follow style that will appeal to anyone, of any age, who wants to begin coding computer programs. You need have no previous knowledge of any computer programming language so it's ideal for the newcomer, including youngsters needing to learn programming basics for the school curriculum. Coding for Beginners in easy steps instructs you how to write code to create your own computer programs. It contains separate chapters demonstrating how to store information in data structures, how to control program flow using control structures, and how to create re-usable blocks of code in program functions. There are complete step-by-step example programs that demonstrate each aspect of coding, together with screenshots that illustrate the actual output when each program has been executed. Coding for Beginners in easy steps begins by explaining how to easily create a programming environment on your own computer, so you can quickly begin to create your own working programs by copying the book's examples. After demonstrating the essential building blocks of computer programming it describes how to code powerful algorithms and demonstrates how to code classes for Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The examples throughout this book feature the popular Python programming language but additionally the final chapter demonstrates a comparison example in the C, C++, and Java programming languages to give you a rounded view of computer coding. The code in the listed steps within the book is colour-coded to precisely match the default colour-coding of the Python IDLE editor, making it easier for beginners to grasp. By the end of this book you will have gained a sound understanding of coding and be able to write your own computer programs that can be run on any compatible computer.",
